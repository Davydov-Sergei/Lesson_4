         <p>
			  Home to the LeMay collection, which once contained an astounding 3000 vehicles, America's Car Museum lies south of
			  Seattle in Tacoma. The collection is quite diverse,  including everything from a Peking-to-Paris CitroÃ«n 2CV and a
			  Duesenberg SJ to an '83 Mercury Colony Park. And for a  measly three bucks extra, you can partake in the grand old
			  American tradition of slot-car racing on site!

			   Blackhawk Museum | Danville, California

		 <p>
			Blackhawk is perhaps best known outside the Bay Area as the place where a down-on-his-luck Tim Armstrong picked up
			donated microwaves and refrigerators before his band Rancid found success with "Salvation," a song detailing his time
			manning a Salvation Army truck. But the ritzy enclave in the far East Bay community of Danville also is home to a
			well-regarded museum with a heavy automotive component. <span>Machines on display range from a 1911 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost
			to a 1958 Pininfarina-bodied Lancia Flaminia coupe to a '70 Dodge Challenger convertible.</span>

			 California Auto Museum | Sacramento, California

			<p>
	       Founded as the Towe Ford Museum in the 1980s, the California Automobile Museum has expanded its mission and collection
		    to embrace other marques. While the joint's still rather centered around American antiques, Malcolm  Forbes's old
		    Lamborghini Countach resides there, as does a Kawasaki KZ1000P motorcycle from the TV show CHiPs. If  you find yourself
		    in California's capital on the third Sunday of any given month, you can hitch a ride around town in a  classic car from
		    the museum. <span> Saoirse Ronan cosplay is completely optional.</span>
